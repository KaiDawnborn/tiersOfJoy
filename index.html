					<h1>Welcome to Tiers of Joy.</h1>
					<p>And we truly mean it. This is an enchanted place built on acceptance, of the unworthy, the marginalized, the victims, the misunderstood. Our only rule here is to love one another. Come as you are and find no judgement here, so long as you bring none of your own.</p>
					<p>Our space is a unique one. You will never find it the same way you left it. It shifts about as a living thing, the vines which make up its walls with minds of their own. In general, however, Tiers of Joy serves four purposes, each depending on the time of day.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>6:00 AM to 12:00 PM - Our space serves as a breakfast cafe, serving warm drinks and light pastries.</li>
						<li>12:00 PM to 6:00 PM - The common area shifts with lunch in mind, serving bar drinks and light fare.</li>
						<li>6:00 PM to 12:00 AM - We turn our focus to relaxing, offering a lounge setting for live music and social drinks.</li>
						<li>12:00 AM to 6:00 AM - Our energy rises, and the space shifts for dancing, with fun drinks and easy-to-eat food.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Of course, we recognize that not all of our patrons are following our particular day-to-day schedule, and we welcome you to order unrestricted from the menu.</p>

					<h1>Events</h1>
					<p>Tiers of Joy hosts a variety of different events, for a variety of different guests. We try to maintain a family-friendly atmosphere, but we understand that some of our more exotic guests will enjoy more exotic events, and we hope you'll understand too.</p>

						<h1>Owners</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>Kai and Valmyth - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy" target="_blank">Fey</a>. They are equal and opposite in many ways, often at once. Kai is often found flitting from table to table, a social whirlwind, while Valmyth is more often observed in a calmer state, typically mentoring guests in some skill or other at a quiet table.</li>
						</ul>

						<h1>Common Room</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>Red - A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buggane" target="_blank">buggane</a>. Our doorman may look anti-social, but he has a soft heart and a surprising sense of humor.</li>
							<li>Tyr - A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faun" target="blank">faun</a>. Our host will gladly seat you if you'd like the best table in the house, or will ensure that you get a server if you choose your own seat.</li>

						<h1>A World of Fantasy</h1>
						<p>Tiers of Joy is a fantasy setting created by myself - Nicole Taylor - and my partner, Mal. It is described as a pocket dimension which exists alongside real-life Earth. The main entrance to the building is in Paris, France, though some guests have found that if they have dire enough need, they may find a hidden path through the magic in the world into some safe part of this place. The interior is shaped from living plants which follow the will of the owners - Kai and Valmyth - and the space hosts all manner of magical and supernatural creatures, as well as regular humans who may or may not be experienced with the magic of the world.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>Kai and Valmyth are each plant-like Fey creatures, much like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryad" target="_blank">wood nymphs</a>. Their race is social by nature, usually living in groups, or Courts, isolated in the wilderness. In a Court, the faeries and fey creatures are connected through magic, and they are all somewhat shaped to the strongest personality - the Prince of the Court. Living away from other Fey, though, Kai and Valmyth have had to make their own Court-like space. Born of a need to guide others and spare them the suffering they've experienced themselves, Kai and Valmyth created Tiers of Joy. The space conforms to their personalities...as does anyone who stays long enough in it.</p>
